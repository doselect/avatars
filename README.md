# Avatars of DoSelect

Everyone loves superheroes, and there is a superhero in all of us. Why not assert our inner superhero using a fitting avatar then?

## Contributing

If you want to add a new superhero avatar to be used as default avatars on DoSelect, please create a PR with your additions. We'll be happy to include it after a short review process.

Please keep in mind the following points though:

- The avatar should be a plain SVG file, with solid background. The width and height of the document should be 200px x 200px.
- There should not be any additional elements in the SVG file except from the avatar.
- The colors should be coherent, and the style should match with the existing avatars.

## Development

You need `inkscape` to generate the dist files. Just run `prepare.sh`.
